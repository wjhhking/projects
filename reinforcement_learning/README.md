# Reinforcement Learning: From Foundations to LLM Coding

A progressive RL implementation project that builds understanding from core algorithms to advanced applications.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Foundational Algorithms in GridWorld
Build understanding of core RL trade-offs using a custom GridWorld environment with jump actions and stochasticity.

**Algorithms to implement:**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** - Model-based value iteration
- **Monte Carlo (MC)** - Model-free, full episodes
- **Temporal Difference (TD)** - Model-free bootstrapping (Q-Learning, SARSA)

### Part 2: Atari Environment Setup
Bridge to complex environments by setting up robust preprocessing pipeline for vision-based tasks.

**Focus:** Environment wrappers and preprocessing for Atari games using Gymnasium.

### Part 3: LLM Coding System
Capstone project using high-level RL libraries (RLlib) to train agents on code generation tasks.

**Approaches:**
- **On-policy (PPO)** with custom transformer models
- **Off-policy (DQN/SAC)** with replay buffer for diverse training data

## Goal
Progress from implementing RL fundamentals to applying advanced algorithms on real-world problems, building both theoretical understanding and practical skills.
